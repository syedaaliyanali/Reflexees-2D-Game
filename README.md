### Reflexees - C++ SFML Game

**Reflexees** is a reaction-based game developed in C++ as part of my semester project for the Computer Systems Engineering program at Dawood University of Engineering and Technology. The game was built using the **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**, focusing on enhancing quick reflexes and precision timing.

#### Features:
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players are challenged to react swiftly as targets appear on the screen. The faster the player reacts, the higher the score!
- **Simple & Intuitive Interface**: A clean and minimalistic design allows for seamless gaming experience.
- **Custom Logic**: Implemented custom game mechanics and rules using object-oriented programming concepts.
- **SFML Integration**: Utilized SFML for handling graphics, game logic, and user inputs.

#### Files Included:
- `Game.cpp`: Contains the core game logic and implementation.
- `Game.h`: Header file for game class definitions.
- `main.cpp`: Entry point of the game, handles initialization and game loop.

Feel free to clone, fork, and improve the game!
